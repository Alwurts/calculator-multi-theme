# Multi theme Calculator

I wanted to try my hand at developing with different UI styles, so I created a calculator that has multiple theme options.
To change the theme of the calculator, you can click on its name and a popup will display the different options.

UI Styles included:
- Neumorphism
- Glassmorphism
- Minimalism

Tools used: 
- React Js
- MUI
- Workbox
